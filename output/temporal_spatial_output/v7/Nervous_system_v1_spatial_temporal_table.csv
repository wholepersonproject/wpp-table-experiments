CN V: Trigeminal@depolarization? CN VII: Facial@depolarization? CN X: Vagus@mechanoreception? equilibrioception@CN VIII receives mechanical stimulation from vestibular hair cells to detect balance? equilibrioception@mechanoreception? phototransduction@CN II hyperpolarizes in response to light? sensory perception of mechanical stimulus@CN V mediates mechanoreception of face and scalp? sensory perception of smell@CN I detects chemical stimuli? sensory perception of sound@CN VIII receives mechanical stimulation from hair cell in cochlea,
1s - < 1min,,CN X: Vagus@ACh release? lacrimation@CN VII depolarization leads (via ACh release) to lacrimation? regulation of gastric acid secretion@ACh release,saliva secretion@CN IX innervates parotid gland via ACh release to trigger salivation? saliva secretion@CN VII depolarization leads (via ACh release) to salivation,"glutamate synthesis@in the glutamine-glutamate cycle, astrocytes uptake glutamate from the synapse and convert it to glutamine with glutamine synthetase. Presynaptic neurons then uptake glutamine and generate glutamate from breaking down glutamine with glutaminase.? peristalsis@CN X synapses on smooth muscle cells of esophagus and stomach to regulate peristalsis? synapse maturation@astrocytes secrete thrombospondin which leads to synapse development and maturation",
