<1 second,constriction of urinary sphincter@internal urethral sphincter of the bladder by sympathetic innervation prevents movement of ejaculate into urinary bladder,"reflex afferent@spinal cord reflex via afferents through S2-S4, efferent activity via motor pudendal nerve. Results in rhythmic contraction of ischiocavernosus, bulbospongiosus? reflex efferent@spinal cord reflex via afferents through S2-S4, efferent activity via motor pudendal nerve. Results in rhythmic contraction of ischiocavernosus, bulbospongiosus? sexual sensation@penis has afferent sensory information transmitted through sensory pudendal nerve? sympathetic innervation@sympathetic outflow from T10-L2 release norepinephrine to induce sphincter constriction",,,
1s - < 1min,,"bulbospongiosus contraction@motor pudendal nerve outflow results in rhythmic contraction of bulbospongiosus? corpus cavernosa relaxation@corpus cavernosum relaxes to allow blood to flow in? corpus spongiosum dilation@corpus spongiosum dilates? ejaculate fluid generation@it is not stored? ejaculate fluid generation@prostate bulbourethral glands secrete ejaculate fluid during coitus? emission of semen from penile urethra@semen leaves penile urethra through urethral meatus? ischiocavernosus contraction@motor pudendal nerve outflow results in rhythmic contraction of ischiocavernosus? parasympathetic innervation@parasympathetic ganglia innervate corpus cavernosum, release ACh and NO to promote vasodilation? penile innervation@motor pudendal nerve innervate striated bulbospongiosus penile muscles? somatic innervation@motor pudendal nerve innervate striated bulbospongiosus penile muscles and contributes to force of ejaculation? sympathetic innervation@sympathetic ganglia innervate ejaculatory ducts",,inhibin B production@indirect marker of Sertoli cell activity? inhibin B production@inhibits FSH release? somatostatin production@parvocellular neurons release somatostatin and dopamine to inhibit the anterior pituitary,
1min - < 1hr,dht secretion@testosterone is converted to DHT in the prostate,,,gonadotropin hormone releasing hormone production@GnRH stimulates LH and FSH release from the anterior pituitary? inhibin B production@indirect marker of Sertoli cell activity? inhibin B production@inhibits FSH release? testosterone production@bone and muscle growth? testosterone production@promotes internal and external male genitalia development? testosterone production@secondary sexual characteristics? testosterone production@spermatogenesis,
1hr - < 1day,,androstenedione production@serves as a precursor to estrogen? seminal plasma generation@70% of the seminal plasma is formed by the seminal vesicle,,peripheral aromatization@converts androstenedione and testosterone to estrogen,
1day - < 1week,,spermatozoa storage@mature spermatozoa remain in the seminal vesicle until ejaculation,,maturation of spermatozoa@spermatozoa mature and increase motility as they progress through the epididymis? spermatogenesis@sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules generate spermatozoa,
1 week - < 1 year,male primary sexual characteristic development@increased testosterone increases penis and testicular development,,,anabolic muscle growth@testosterone leads to male pattern muscle growth,
