1min - < 1hr,,"RANK/RANKL signaling@OPG is a decoy receptor that binds RANKL, reducing its effective concentration to bind RANK",,"bone metabolism@mechanical loading acts directly on osteocytes, then through osteoblasts via sclerostin and RANKL? calcitonin production@calcitonin lowers serum calcium by inhibiting bone resorption? osteocalcin production@osteocalcin is produced by osteoblasts and indicates increased bone turnover? parathyroid hormone release@PTH increases calcium and decreases phosphate by promoting reabsorption in the kidney, increasing bone resorption, increasing vitamin D activation, and increasing calcium uptake from the small intestine? sclerostin production@antagonist of Wnt signaling? sclerostin production@sclerostin is secreted by osteocytes and inhibits osteoblasts",
