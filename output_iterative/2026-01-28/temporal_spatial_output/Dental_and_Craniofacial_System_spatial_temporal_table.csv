<1 second,,CN IX: Glossophar.@CN IX receives pain signals from the oropharynx? eye movement@CN III innervates extraocular muscles to control eye movement? eye movement@CN IV Innervates the superior oblique to control eye movement? eye movement@CN VI innervates lateral rectus? eyelid movement@CN III innervates the levator palpebrae superioris to control eyelid movement? facial expression@CN VII innervates muscles of facial expression? lacrimation@CN VII depolarization leads (via ACh release) to lacrimation? mastication@CN V innervates masseter to trigger jaw contraction? mastication@CN V innervates pterygoid to trigger jaw contraction? mastication@CN V innervates temporalis to trigger jaw contraction? phototransduction@CN II hyperpolarizes in response to light? pupillary constriction@CN III innervates sphincter pupillae to enable pupillary constriction? pupillary dilation@sympathetic nerve from the hypothalamus innervates the dilatator pupillae to enable pupillary dilation? saliva secretion@CN VII depolarization leads (via ACh release) to salivation? sensory perception of mechanical stimulus@CN V mediates mechanoreception of face and scalp? sensory perception of pain@CN V receives pain signal from tooth? sensory perception of smell@CN I detects chemical stimuli? sensory perception of sound@CN VIII receives mechanical stimulation from hair cell in cochlea? sensory perception of taste@CN IX receives chemical info from taste buds on posterior tongue? sensory perception of taste@CN VII receives chemical stimulation from gustatory receptor? skeletal muscle contraction@CN XII innervates muscles of the tongue? swallowing@CN IX innervates the stylopharyngeus to coordinate swallowing? swallowing@CN X innervates pharyngeal constrictor to coordinate swallowing? swallowing@pharyngeal plexus gets contribution from CN IX and X to innervate the pharyngeal constrictors,,equilibrioception@CN VIII receives mechanical signals from vestibular hair cells in the utricle and saccule to gain positional information? equilibrioception@CN VIII receives mechanical stimulation from vestibular hair cells to detect balance,
1s - < 1min,,saliva secretion@CN IX innervates parotid gland via ACh release to trigger salivation,,,
1min - < 1hr,,"RANK/RANKL signaling@OPG is a decoy receptor that binds RANKL, reducing its effective concentration to bind RANK",,"bone metabolism@mechanical loading acts directly on osteocytes, then through osteoblasts via sclerostin and RANKL? calcitonin production@calcitonin lowers serum calcium by inhibiting bone resorption? osteocalcin production@osteocalcin is produced by osteoblasts and indicates increased bone turnover? parathyroid hormone release@PTH increases calcium and decreases phosphate by promoting reabsorption in the kidney, increasing bone resorption, increasing vitamin D activation, and increasing calcium uptake from the small intestine? sclerostin production@antagonist of Wnt signaling? sclerostin production@sclerostin is secreted by osteocytes and inhibits osteoblasts",
