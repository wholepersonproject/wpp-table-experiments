"List physiological functions as a hierarchy, starting with the body system in Function/1 (this should be the same as the table name), a major life function in Function/2, and more specific functions in subsequent columns. Add more columns if needed. Place limited explanatory text if needed in Function/Notes. Each function should include a ID from Gene Ontology (GO) if possible or another standard ontology. The LABEL column is the label for that ID as it appears in that ontology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Provide a very brief description (a few words) of the specific processes that occur during the corresponding function (e.g., a chemical reaction, physical change, feedback loop, etc.) in the Process column. Enter whether the Effector is a cell, tissue, or organ. Provide the anatomical location of the Effector in EffectorLocation along with the associated UBERON ID, if avaialble. Enter the Effector and its UBERON ID in the following columns. See Glossary for detailed instructions on tabulating the Signal, Effect, Behavior, Behavior X, Behavior Y, and X Target columns.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Indicate the signal scale category for this process: autocrine, paracrine, intra-organ, circulatory, systemic","Indicate the signal scale category for this process: autocrine, paracrine, intra-organ, circulatory, systemic","Indicate the time scale category for this process: milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, years.","OPTIONAL FOR NOW. List clinical measures, such as laboratory tests, vital signs, or radiology studies, related to the physiological function. These columns are simple lists and are NOT hierarchical. Include an ID for the measurement, such as a LOINC code, if known. Add more columns if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,"OPTIONAL FOR NOW. List other interacting physiological functions. These columns are simple lists and NOT hierarchical. Add more columns if needed. For the LABEL and ID columns, use Gene Ontology (GO) if possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,"REQUIRED. Enter references in support of the information on this row. The ID column should include a standard identifier, such as a DOI or ISBN. The optional CHAPTER column should be used to list the relevant chapters in a book. The optional NOTES column can be used to clarify which part of the row the reference is for, such as a reference about the anatomical structures involved in the function rather than the interactions. Add more sets of reference columns if needed, making sure to include the ID column.",,,,,,,,,,,
